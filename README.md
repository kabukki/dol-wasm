# ðŸ’¾ CHIP-8

A **CHIP-8** emulator written in Rust compiled to WebAssemly for usage on the web.

> CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker. It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in the mid-1970s. CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8 virtual machine. It was made to allow video games to be more easily programmed for these computers.

## Toolchain

The emulator is written in Rust and compiled into a WebAssembly module through [wasm-pack](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack) and uses [wasm-bindgen](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen) to ease interoperability with the JavaScript environment. A custom JavaScript file wraps the produced package for convenience when consuming it in JavaScript.

```
.rs ---[wasm-pack]---> .wasm <--> JS wrapper <--- JS
```

The emitted JS wrapper is distributed as an ES Module.
